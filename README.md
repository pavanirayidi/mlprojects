Viryal Painting is an OpenCV application that can track an object’s movement, using which a user can draw on the screen by moving the object around — I call it Webcam Paint.
Video tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication and compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing.
